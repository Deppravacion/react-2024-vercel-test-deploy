  nursing under her belt, she's not just our founder and President but
  also your go-to person for all things caring and compassionate.
  Lisa's journey with Way to Health started with her first mission
  trip to Haiti in 2014, and the rest, as they say, is history.After
  lots of prayers and a hefty dose of determination, Way to Health
  officially took flight in 2016. Lisa's been fearlessly leading
  medical missions all over Haiti since then, but her heart found a
  special place in the vibrant communities of Cite Soleil. It's become
  the heartbeat of Way to Health.Having Lisa in your life means
  inevitably catching the Way to Health bug because her passion and
  Godly heart are just too contagious to resist.`,

    our Vice President, Julie spearheads some of our most impactful
    projects, with the latest gem being the Malnourished Baby Feeding
    Initiative.In 2017, Julie took a leap of faith and joined her first
    mission trip. Being on the ground, seeing the direct impact of the
    work she and the Board contribute, changed her perspective forever.

    her dedication to our cause shines through in everything she does.`,
