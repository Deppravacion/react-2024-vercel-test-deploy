        <strong>MISSIONARY EXPENSES</strong>
        <p className="mb-6">
          A common question: what does it cost to go on a mission trip? Here is
          a price breakdown per missionary. During an 6-day mission trip,
          missionaries typically incur an estimated cost of $760 for the trip
          itself. Additionally, airfare expenses range from $600 to $800
          round-trip. Missionaries participating in our mission trips are
          relieved of the financial burden associated with various expenses. The
          foundation covers all work related costs, including travel to clinics,
          medical staff pay, translator pay, security pay, and the expenses
          incurred for medications used in clinics, and any additional patient
          treatments. The fundraising before each trip allows our missionaries
          to focus solely on the important work of the foundation without having
          to worry about these additional financial responsibilities.
