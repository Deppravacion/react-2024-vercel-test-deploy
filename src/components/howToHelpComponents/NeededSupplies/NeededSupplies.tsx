          Way to Health welcomes both monetary and physical donations for our
          mission in Haiti. We're in constant need of wound care items, expired
          or not, including tape, 4x4â€™s, kerlex, and wound drainage dressings.
          Children's fever medicine (Tylenol and ibuprofen) is also appreciated.
          Electronics, especially computers and cell phones, help us stay
          connected with our Haitian team. Whatever is donated always finds a
          use!
