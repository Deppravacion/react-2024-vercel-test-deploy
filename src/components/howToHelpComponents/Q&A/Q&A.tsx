        Q: How many days is a typical mission trip?
        <br />
        A: Each trip is anywhere between 6-9 days, but each trip varies
        depending on the missionaries that attend and their availability.
        <br /> Q: How often are the mission trips? A: We aim to organize three
        mission trips annually, contingent upon interest, safety considerations,
        and funding availability.
        <br />
        Q: Can non-medical individuals join? <br />
        A: Absolutely. Everyone has a valuable role on the mission trip, whether
        it's helping with patient vitals, engaging with children, or
        participating in evangelism. There's always a need for an extra helping
        hand, and your contribution is essential.
        <br />
        Q: Will I be safe?
        <br />
        A: Safety is a top priority for us, particularly in the challenging
        environment of Cite Soleil, Haiti. Our dedicated on-the-ground team in
        Cite Soleil continually assesses the safety conditions for our mission.
        If an area is deemed unsafe while our team is present, we proactively
        explore alternative needs in safer locations or prioritize the safety of
        our team by staying at the guesthouse. <br />
        Q: What if I get hurt?
        <br />
        A: As a missionary, your expenses cover essential medical insurance. In
        the unfortunate event of a severe injury beyond the scope of our on-site
        medical team, your insurance ensures a secure return to the United
        States for proper and comprehensive treatment.
